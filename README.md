# ISC20-ArtShow
This artwork shows my ability to work with p5.js and my basic understanding of JS.

##Individualized Creative Refactor
I gave this program the ability to:
- Randomly generate ellipses/rectangles,
- Randomly vary the sizes of said ellipses/rectangles,
- Change the color of the ellipses, rectangles, button and text based on the mouse's position,
- Change the alpha/opacity of the shapes based on their size,
- Be button-activated,
- Have a title screen, a screen showing the animation and an end screen
